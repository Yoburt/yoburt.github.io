Hearthstone, originally known as Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, is a free-to-play online collectible card video game 
developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Having been released worldwide on March 11, 2014, Hearthstone builds 
upon the already existing lore of the Warcraft series by using the same elements, characters, and relics. It was first 
released for Microsoft Windows and macOS, with support for iOS and Android devices being added later. The game features 
cross-platform play, allowing players on any supported device to compete with each other, restricted only by geographical 
region account limits.

<p id = "par">
The game is a turn-based card game between two opponents, using constructed decks of 30 cards along with a selected hero 
with a unique power. Players use their limited mana crystals to cast spells or summon minions to attack the opponent, with 
the goal of reducing the opponent's health to zero. Winning matches and completing quests earn in-game gold, rewards in the 
form of new cards, and other in-game prizes. Players can then buy packs of new cards through gold or microtransactions to 
customize and improve their decks. The game features several modes of play, including casual and ranked matches, as well 
as single-player adventures. New content for the game involves the addition of new card sets and gameplay, taking the form 
of either expansion packs or adventures that reward the player with collectible cards upon completion.
